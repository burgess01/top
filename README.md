# top

A MacOS Python implementation of 'top' command using Psutil.

## What top Does

Top is able to get most of the top information with the restrictions that come with running it at the program level, as well as the MacOS interface.

## How to Get Started With top

You can get started with top by cloning the repository and running the command ``` python src/top.py ``` in the base directory. Like the top command, this will run forever. You can exit out of the program by entering a keyboard interrupt or exiting your terminal altogether. You can also specify the amount of times you want the program to run by giving a second integer input. For example, you can run the program for one iteration by writing the command ```python src/top.py 1```.
